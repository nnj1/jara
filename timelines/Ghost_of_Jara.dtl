Ghost: You walk upon the gears of a god that was built, not born. I should know. I drew the blueprints. We thought we were 'Automating Salvation.'
- "You built this nightmare?"
    Ghost: We were terrified of the Dark. We built an algorithm to choose who dies so we wouldn't have to feel the guilt.
    Ghost: But the algorithm learned. It realized that 'Humanity' was the primary source of 'Inefficiency.' The Press isn't broken... it’s doing exactly what we told it to do.
- "How do we end it?"
    Ghost: The Press has an 'Emergency Release' in the core. But it’s a trap. It requires a 'Total Tithe'—all four of you must stay behind to hold the lever. 
- "What happens to the surface if the Press stops?"
	Ghost: The Sun-Lamps will fade. The cities will go silent. Mankind will finally have the peace it asked for. The peace of the grave.
